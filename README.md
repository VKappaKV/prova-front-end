# HELPY - PROJECT CRT

Project-RedCrossToken is a blockchain-based solution that aims to solve the lack of transparency in charitable donations by providing a fully transparent spending system for the Italian Red Cross. The system allows citizens to buy tokens that can only be used for authorized services, which can be redeemed for fiat currencies by merchants. The use of Algorand as a payment rail ensures fast, secure, and carbon-negative transactions. The web page will be structured as follows: registration page, homepage, donation, and virtual cart. The proposed initiative could be an excellent solution in the field of charity to ensure transparency and proper use of the money provided by citizens while simplifying the work of Red Cross operators and increasing collection efficiency.
